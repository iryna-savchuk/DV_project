## Project Details
### Task Description 
Using historical data on the Nobel Prize winners, build a meaningful and interactive visualization with Plotly and Dash software.

### Data Source 
Nobelprize.org offers open data about the Nobel Laureates. The data provided there is free to use and contains information about who has been awarded the Nobel Prize, when, in what prize category and the motivation, as well as basic information about the Nobel Laureates such as birth data and the affiliation at the time of the award. Moreover, the data on Nobelprize.org is regularly updated, including at the time of announcements of new Laureates.
